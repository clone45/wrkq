# SQLite Migration Completion Guide

This document provides detailed instructions for completing the migration from MongoDB to SQLite in the Job Tracker application.

## Migration Status

The migration process has already been completed with the following components:

1. **Data Migration**: The `scripts/migrate.py` script has successfully migrated data from MongoDB to SQLite.

2. **Connection Layer**: The database connection class has been updated to use SQLite instead of MongoDB.

3. **Repository Layer**: All repository classes have been updated to use SQL queries instead of MongoDB operations.

4. **Model Layer**: Model classes have been updated to support SQLite data format.

5. **Service Layer**: Service classes have been updated to use the new repository implementations.

6. **UI Layer**: User dependencies have been removed from the UI.

## Dependencies Updates

- MongoDB dependencies have been removed
- The application now uses SQLite, which is part of Python's standard library

## Running the Application

Before running the application, you should verify the SQLite database:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_db.py
```

This script will:
- Verify the SQLite database exists
- Create database schema if needed
- Show record counts for each table

Then you can run the application:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

## Required Packages

### Removed
- pymongo
- bson

### Added
- None (SQLite is included in Python's standard library)

You will need to have the following packages installed for the UI:
- textual (for the terminal UI)

## Further Steps

1. **Manual Testing**: Verify that all features work correctly with the new SQLite backend:
   - Listing jobs
   - Adding jobs
   - Hiding jobs
   - Job applications
   - Chat functionality

2. **Clean Up**:
   - Remove any remaining MongoDB references in the code
   - Remove MongoDB connection strings from configuration files
   - Update the documentation to reflect the new SQLite architecture

3. **Potential Improvements**:
   - Add database indexes for better performance
   - Implement better error handling for SQLite-specific errors
   - Consider adding a database migration system for future schema changes

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter database-related errors:

1. Check that the SQLite database file exists at the configured path
2. Verify that the database schema is properly created
3. Check file permissions for the database file
4. Look for SQLite-specific errors in the logs

For UI-related errors:
1. Make sure textual package is installed
2. Check for any remaining MongoDB references in the UI code

## Conclusion

The application now uses SQLite instead of MongoDB, which provides several benefits:
- No external database server required
- Simpler setup and deployment
- Database file can be easily backed up

SQLite should be adequate for the needs of this application, as it doesn't require high concurrency or distributed access.
