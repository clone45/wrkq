I'd be happy to help you learn about OpenAI's newest SDK for Python. Let me search for the latest information to get us both up to speed.

Based on my search, I can share the following information about OpenAI's newest Python SDK:

## Key Features of the Latest OpenAI Python SDK

The OpenAI Python SDK requires Python 3.8 or higher and provides access to OpenAI's REST API with both synchronous and asynchronous clients powered by httpx. The library includes comprehensive type definitions for all request parameters and response fields.

The primary API for interacting with OpenAI models is now the Responses API, which has largely replaced the older Chat Completions approach in newer versions. All object responses in the SDK provide a `_request_id` property from the response header for easier debugging and error reporting.

The SDK now includes better error handling mechanisms. Certain errors are automatically retried with exponential backoff, and there's a specific way to handle errors in the Realtime API where errors are sent as events rather than raising exceptions directly.

## New Features and SDKs

OpenAI has recently released an Agents SDK, which is a lightweight framework for building multi-agent AI applications. This SDK includes features like Agents (LLMs with instructions and tools), Handoffs (for transferring control between agents), Guardrails (for input validation), and built-in tracing for debugging and optimization.

## Getting Started

Here's a basic example of how to use the latest SDK:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize the client
client = OpenAI()  # API key is loaded from environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY by default

# Generate text using the Responses API
response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    input="Say 'this is a test'."
)

print(response.text)
# Access the request ID for logging/debugging
print(response._request_id)
```

For Azure OpenAI:

```python
from openai import AzureOpenAI

client = AzureOpenAI(
    api_version="2023-07-01-preview",
    azure_endpoint="https://example-endpoint.openai.azure.com"
)

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="deployment-name",  # your model deployment name
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "How do I output all files in a directory using Python?"}
    ]
)
print(completion.to_json())
```

Here's an example of using structured outputs:


```python
from openai import OpenAI
import json
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv()

# Initialize the client with API key from environment variables
client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

# Define the JSON schema for job information
schema = {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "title": {"type": "string"},
        "company": {"type": "string"},
        "location": {"type": "string"},
        "description": {"type": "string"},
        "posted_date": {"type": "string"},
        "salary": {"type": "string"}
    },
    "required": ["title", "company", "location", "description"],
    "additionalProperties": False
}

# Create the prompt
prompt = f"""
Please extract the job information from this LinkedIn job posting: 
https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4213625031/

Return the data following the specified schema.
"""

# Make the API call with structured output
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",  # Use a model that supports structured outputs
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that extracts job information from URLs."},
        {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
    ],
    response_format={"type": "json_schema", "schema": schema}
)

# Extract the structured data
structured_data = json.loads(response.choices[0].message.content)
print(json.dumps(structured_data, indent=2))
```

## .env File Format

Your `.env` file should be created in the root directory of your project and should look like this:

```
# OpenAI API credentials
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key-here
```

To use this setup:

1. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install openai python-dotenv
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in your project root with your API key
3. Make sure to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to avoid accidentally sharing your API keys
4. Run your script, which will automatically load the environment variables using `load_dotenv()`

This approach is more secure than hardcoding your API key directly in your code, especially if you're working on a shared or public repository.
