**Creating mini developer's guide**

The user wants a concise yet explanatory guide on using overlay panels in the Python `textual` library, likely in markdown format. They requested a "mini developer’s guide," so it should be more than a quick snippet. While the topic is specific to the `textual` library, I'll gather the necessary info, possibly reviewing the latest docs to ensure accuracy, especially for overlay panel features. No need for location, and I’ve got the basics covered, but I’ll check the docs to ensure the guide is up-to-date.

**Confirming version details**

The user mentioned the newest version, so I need to double-check which version of Textual is the most current. Based on their context, it’s likely Textual 0.59, but as of May 2025, it could be 0.62. I should confirm the exact version and ensure the latest updates are reflected in my response. I’ll look up the most recent version to be sure about those details.


**Confirming latest version details**

The user asked about the newest version previously, and while Textual 0.59 seemed likely, it could now be 0.62 as of 2025. I’ll check the latest version, especially considering today’s date, May 4, 2025. In my search, I didn’t find specific documentation on overlay panels just yet, but I can still browse through available docs to verify the current information. Let me open those to ensure accuracy!


**Searching for overlay panel info**

The user asked about the latest Textual version, so I’ll make sure I have the correct one for May 2025. I found that overlay panels in Textual likely use layers and CSS's `z-index` to manage how panels overlay base content. Textual also supports modals and docks, particularly for left-side overlays. I’ll search for examples like the Slide or side panels in `textualize` to validate this and get a clearer answer for the user.


**Exploring overlay panel options**

The user asked about the newest version of Textual, and I'm confirming Textual 0.59 or possibly 0.62 as the latest in May 2025. I wasn't able to directly find overlay panel docs at first, but I think it's likely linked to layer handling, docking, and the `z-index` CSS property to overlay content. Textual supports modals or docks for left-side overlays. I’ll now focus on the 'Docking' and 'Layer' docs to find relevant details and examples for the overlay functionality.


**Finding overlay panel options**

The user mentioned the latest version of Textual, so I was confirming whether it’s 0.59 or possibly later at 0.62. I couldn’t find overlay panel docs initially, but I suspect it involves layers, docking, and `z-index` properties to create panels. Textual also supports modals and docks for left-side overlays. I searched further and found relevant documentation on Dock (sidebars) and Layers (overlays) to help clarify how to implement the sliding panel functionality.

**Creating overlay side panels**

To create a left-side overlay panel, we can dock it to the left and adjust layers to overlay over the main content. Add key bindings for toggling visibility or width changes. The mini guide would cover:

1. Concept overview: side panels and overlays
2. Key classes: App, Container, Widget
3. CSS essentials: dock property, dimensions, z-layers
4. Animating overlays using programmatic style changes
5. Visibility control: show/hide or CSS display tweaks

I'll focus on concise info and provide a code snippet. Should I create a downloadable markdown link?

### Mini Developer’s Guide: Overlay Side Panels in **Textual**

---

#### 1.  Core ideas

| Concept                | Why it matters                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Docking**            | Fix a widget to the left edge (`dock: left;`), so it never scrolls away ([Textual Documentation][1])                                                                                |
| **Layers**             | Give the panel its own higher‑priority layer (`layers: base overlay;` then `layer: overlay;`) so it *overlaps* the main UI instead of shoving it aside ([Textual Documentation][2]) |
| **Animation / offset** | Slide the panel in and out by animating `offset` or toggling `display:none`; keeps the DOM intact and avoids re‑layout churn.                                                       |

#### 2.  Minimal skeleton

```python
from textual.app import App, ComposeResult
from textual.containers import Container
from textual.widgets import Static

class SidePanel(Static):
    DEFAULT_CSS = """
    SidePanel {
        dock: left;
        width: 30;          /* cells */
        height: 100%;
        background: dark_cyan;
        padding: 1 2;
        layer: overlay;     /* draws above base */
        offset: -30 0;      /* start off‑screen */
        transition: offset 300ms ease-out;
    }
    """

class Main(App):
    CSS = """
    Screen { layers: base overlay; }
    """

    BINDINGS = [("p", "toggle_panel", "Toggle side panel")]

    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        yield Container(id="body")              # base layer content
        yield SidePanel("I’m an overlay panel", id="panel")

    def action_toggle_panel(self) -> None:
        panel = self.query_one("#panel")
        # Slide in/out by moving the x offset
        panel.offset = (0, 0) if panel.offset.x < 0 else (-panel.size.width, 0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    Main().run()
```

#### 3.  What to tweak

| Need                         | Tweak                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Hide completely**          | `panel.display = False` or add/remove a “hidden” CSS class.                                |
| **No overlay, push content** | Drop the `layer:` rule; the docked sidebar will shrink the remaining layout.               |
| **Slide from right**         | `dock: right; offset: 30 0` and animate the negative value.                                |
| **Temporary modal**          | Combine `layer: overlay` with a semi‑transparent full‑screen *scrim* container underneath. |

---

#### 4.  Common pitfalls

* **Overlap order wrong?** The later widget *and* the higher layer wins. Check both yield order and `layer:` setting.
* **Panel scrolls with content**: ensure the panel itself is *docked*; children inside it can scroll.
* **Animations “jump”**: always set an initial `offset` (or width) in the widget’s `DEFAULT_CSS` before you animate.

---

#### 5.  Next steps

* Add keyboard‑trap focus handling (e.g., move focus into the panel on open).
* Hook into your app’s state (reloading lists, forms, etc.) inside the `SidePanel` widget.
* Explore the `animate()` helper if you prefer imperative animation: `await panel.animate("offset_x", 0, duration=0.3)`.

That’s all you need for a clean, modern slide‑out panel in Textual—happy coding!
