# What is a Battle Plan?

## Overview

A Battle Plan is a strategic document created before diving into code implementation. It serves as a roadmap that outlines the steps, challenges, and approaches for completing a programming task or project. Unlike traditional documentation that might focus on what has been done, a Battle Plan focuses on what will be done and how it will be approached.  You should research, as necessary, before writing the battle plan.  You should write the
battle plan to /docs/battle_plans/{give_it_a_name}.md

It's important to note that although I specify categories below, I leave it up to you to decide what to include.  If,
for example, there are minimal Potential Challenges and Solutions, just note that you don't forsee any issues.  Also
notices that I've left out testing.  For now, I'll (Bret) test the features myself once they have been implemented.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of a Battle Plan is to:

1. Force structured thinking before writing any code
2. Create a clear roadmap for implementation
3. Identify potential challenges and edge cases early
4. Serve as a reference during implementation
5. Document the thought process for future reference

## When to Create a Battle Plan

Create a Battle Plan when:
- Starting a new feature implementation
- Refactoring a significant portion of code
- Fixing a complex bug
- Integrating a new technology or library
- Planning any development task that spans multiple files or components

## Structure of a Battle Plan

A good Battle Plan includes:

### 1. Header Information
- Date of creation
- Task/feature name

### 2. Problem Statement
- Clear description of what needs to be accomplished
- Context and background information
- Constraints and requirements

### 3. Approach Overview
- High-level strategy for solving the problem
- Architectural decisions and their rationale
- Technology choices (if relevant)

### 4. Implementation Steps
- Detailed, sequential list of steps to implement the solution
- Each step should be specific and actionable
- Include file paths and component names where changes will be made
- Specify data structures, algorithms, and patterns to be used
- Minimal code, if any, should be included.  We're not yet focused on implementation.

### 5. Potential Challenges and Solutions
- Identify foreseeable challenges or edge cases
- Propose solutions or approaches to handle these challenges
- Note any uncertain areas that may require research

## Example Format

```markdown
# Battle Plan: [Feature/Task Name]

**Date:** [Current Date]
**Author:** AI Assistant
**Related Issue:** [Issue/Ticket Number if applicable]

## Problem Statement
[Description of what needs to be accomplished]

## Approach Overview
[High-level strategy]

## Implementation Steps
1. [Step 1]
   - [Sub-step 1.1]
   - [Sub-step 1.2]
2. [Step 2]
   - [Sub-step 2.1]
   - [Sub-step 2.2]
...

## Potential Challenges
- [Challenge 1]
  - [Proposed solution]
- [Challenge 2]
  - [Proposed solution]
...

```

## Best Practices

1. **Be specific**: Include file paths, function names, and component references
2. **No implementation code**: The plan should focus on strategy, not implementation details
3. **Think steps, not solutions**: Focus on the process rather than writing actual code
4. **Consider alternatives**: Note why one approach was chosen over others
5. **Update as needed**: The plan is a living document that can evolve as implementation progresses
6. **File location**: Store battle plans in the `docs/battle_plans/` directory

## Benefits of Battle Plans

- **Improved planning**: Forces thorough consideration of the problem before writing code
- **Better documentation**: Creates a record of decision-making that helps future developers
- **Reduced errors**: Identifies potential issues before they arise in code
- **Streamlined implementation**: Provides a clear checklist to follow during development
- **Enhanced collaboration**: Makes it easier for multiple developers to understand the approach

Remember: The time spent creating a Battle Plan is an investment that pays dividends during implementation and maintenance.
