# Battle Plan: Add "Mark Applied" Menu to Job Actions

## Problem Statement
We need to add a "Mark Applied" menu option to the JobActionsModal in job_actions.py. When selected, this option will mark a job as applied by creating entries in both the applications table and the history table. The feature will help users track which jobs they've submitted applications for.

## Approach Overview
We'll extend the existing JobActionsModal to include a new "Mark Applied" button. When clicked, it will call a callback function that creates an application record via the ApplicationService and also adds an entry to the history table. The modal interface will follow the same pattern as existing functions like "Hide Job" and "Delete Job".

## Implementation Steps

1. Update JobActionsModal constructor in job_actions.py
   - Add a new `mark_applied_callback` parameter to the constructor
   - Store the callback as an instance attribute

2. Update the UI in JobActionsModal.compose()
   - Add a new "Mark Applied" button to the actions list
   - Position it before the Hide and Delete buttons
   - Use a distinct variant like "success" to differentiate it

3. Update the button handler in on_button_pressed()
   - Add a new condition for the "mark-applied-button" id
   - Call the mark_applied_callback with the job_id
   - Dismiss the modal after the action

4. Create new callback in JobsScreen class
   - Create a `_mark_applied_callback` method in jobs_screen.py
   - Method will use the application_service to create a new application
   - Method will add an entry to the history table for tracking

5. Update the show_job_actions method in JobsScreen
   - Add the application_service as a dependency to JobsScreen
   - Pass the new _mark_applied_callback to the JobActionsModal constructor

6. Update any CSS styling needed for the new button
   - Check if job_actions.tcss needs updates for the new button

## Potential Challenges

1. **History Table Implementation**
   - The history table appears to be somewhat outdated according to comments
   - Solution: We'll need to create or verify a history repo if it doesn't exist, similar to other repos

2. **Duplicate Applications**
   - Users might try to mark a job as applied multiple times
   - Solution: Use application_service.by_job_id() to check if an application already exists before creating a new one

3. **UI Feedback**
   - Users need clear feedback about the action's outcome
   - Solution: Add appropriate notifications confirming the action or explaining errors

4. **Dependency Injection**
   - Need to ensure ApplicationService is available in JobsScreen
   - Solution: Update the di.py file if needed and ensure proper initialization in JobsScreen
