# Battle Plan: Add Import Jobs Screen

**Date:** April 29, 2025
**Author:** AI Assistant

## Problem Statement
The application needs a new dedicated screen for importing jobs, which will be accessed by pressing the "i" key. Initially, this screen should be a minimal placeholder that can be opened and closed properly. The actual job import functionality will be implemented in subsequent iterations.

## Approach Overview
We'll add a new import jobs screen to the application following the existing pattern used for the AddJobScreen. The screen will be minimal in this first iteration, focusing on establishing the screen, its navigation, and key bindings. It will be integrated with the main application and accessible through the "i" key binding.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create Import Jobs Screen Component**
   - Create a new file `/job_tracker/ui/screens/import_jobs_screen.py`
   - Implement a minimal `ImportJobsScreen` class that inherits from `Screen`
   - Set up the basic screen structure with header, content container, and footer
   - Add escape binding to return to the main screen

2. **Create CSS for Import Jobs Screen**
   - Create a new CSS file `/job_tracker/ui/css/import_jobs_screen.tcss`
   - Add basic styling for the import jobs screen components
   - Keep it simple with minimal styling in this iteration

3. **Update Main App**
   - Modify `/job_tracker/ui/app.py` to:
     - Add the new CSS path for the import jobs screen
     - Add a key binding for "i" to open the import jobs screen
     - Implement the corresponding action method to push the import jobs screen

4. **Integration Tests**
   - Manually test that the "i" key opens the new screen
   - Ensure that the Escape key returns to the main screen as expected
   - Verify the screen displays properly with its basic components

## Potential Challenges

- **Key Binding Conflicts**: The "i" key might conflict with existing functionality. Solution: review current key bindings in the application to ensure "i" is available.

- **Screen Management**: Ensure proper screen stack management when pushing/popping screens. Solution: follow the existing pattern used for the add job screen to maintain consistency.

- **Future Integration**: The current minimal implementation needs to be designed with future functionality in mind. Solution: structure the screen in a way that allows for easy addition of import-related features in future iterations.
